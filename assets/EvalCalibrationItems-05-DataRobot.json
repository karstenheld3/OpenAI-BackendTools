Its primary revenue streams include **discount revenue** (from cardholder spending), **net card fees**, **service fees**, and **interest income**, with costs primarily related to interest expenses, operating expenses (e.g., marketing, compensation), and provisions for credit losses.  In FY2022, American Express reported a **25% increase in total revenues net of interest expense**, driven by higher billed business (23% growth), inflation, and FX adjustments. However, gross margin (which typically measures revenue minus cost of goods sold) is not a standard metric for financial institutions like American Express, as they do not sell physical goods. Instead, key drivers of profitability include:   - **Higher billed business** (23% growth, 36% FX-adjusted) from consumer and commercial spending.   - **Increased net interest income** (28% growth) due to higher Card Member loans and interest rates.   - **Rising operating expenses** (24% increase), including equity investment losses and compensation costs.   - **Provisions for credit losses** ($617M reserve build vs. $2.5B release in 2021).   Thus, gross margin is not applicable here.

However, this is speculative without concrete data.  ### **Follow-Up Question Suggestion for You (to potentially get a more direct answer here)** * If you can provide the specific year or timeframe you're interested in, I might be able to offer a more informed speculative answer based on the artists' typical activity levels around that time (though still not definitive without the exact tool/output).  ### **Example of How I'd Format the Answer if I Had the Tool's Output** #### **Hypothetical Output from `MusicReleaseComparator`** | **Artist**       | **# of Releases in Specified Timeframe** | |------------------|-----------------------------------------| | Vince Gill      | 5                                       | | Beastie Boys    | 0                                       | #### **Formatted Answer with Hypothetical Output** **Answer:**  Based on the `MusicReleaseComparator` tool for [Specify Timeframe, e.g., \"2022\"]: * **Vince Gill** had **5 song releases**. * **Beastie Boys** had **0 song releases** (consistent with their retirement from recording music). **Conclusion:** Vince Gill had more song releases in the specified timeframe.  --- **Please respond with:** 1.

In a leap year, the percentage would be slightly less due to 53 weeks, but the difference would be negligible (≈ 13.21%).  **Source (Context Provided):** - The article mentions \"Adele's _25_ finishes 2016 as the most popular release of the year in the U.S., according to Nielsen Music, with 4.14 million equivalent album units during the year -- with 1.61 million of that sum coming from traditional album sales.\" - It also states, \"Adele's _25_ is far and away the chart's year-end winner\" and initially spent \"10 weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Billboard 200\" but does not specify the exact weeks in 2016.
